# Disposable Email Generator - WIP

A program which will spit out a specified number of 'disposable' email addresses, eg. 'matthewalbatross@mailinator.com'

Names are randomised using random byte access and rejection sampling on name and noun lists.

The addresses, though random, should receive email. Links to access them may be added.
