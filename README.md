# Disposable Email Generator

A program which will spit out a specified number of 'disposable' email addresses, eg. 'matthewalbatross@mailinator.com'

Names are randomised using random byte access (speed!) and rejection sampling (fairness!) on word lists. These lists aren't wrapped up in the exe but instead stored in the same folder, so modify at will....

The addresses, though random, should receive email, with no unpleasant undeliverableness.
